Mission Statement

Everyone has an identity in life, everyone is a unique individual.  A Photo turned NFT to represent, reaffirm, and foster this concept of value is gratifying, fun, and establishes an inherent concept that others are unique individuals as well. A photo, minted into a NFT(s) of individuals has value, and after entering NiFTree, has scarcity!
The Family Tree Photo concept is a beginning, a baby step towards a larger, much larger plan of inclusion.  Friends, large groups of friends, organizations, clubs, sport clubs and so many others can get in on the action as well!

Use case/Summary Overview

The problem we are trying to solve is large social media corporations are gathering data on users and using and/or selling persons photographs and pertinent data at their profit. We hope to solve this problem, by bringing value back to the Photographers.  With a NiFTree the user gets to keep photos, store them and trade them and build photo albums, and they have value.
    Identity Value
    Monetary Value (Trade, Sell, Gift)
A sense of being an individual with a stake, share, in something bigger.
This appeals to all our natures, people want to be recognized as an individual, and also want to belong to something, some group that has meaning, focus, fun!

Methodology

Build a smart contract using Cadence > using Resources and Mint a NFT of a Photo(s) and resend to Member (Photographer) for storage. (NonFungibleToken.cdc)
  (A family Member or Photographer sends Photos to a Publisher (NiFTree) for minting and recieves a Framed Photo)
  (The color of the Frame will denote scarcity)
Establish collections of pictures via transactions to trade, share, and contain (store) and add to a Photo Collection, or Photo Album.
When a Photo Album is created and multiple members have completed and shared, a group vote for best of show takes place.
Winner recieves special (diamond) Framed Photo.
